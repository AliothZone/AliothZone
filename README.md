- 👋 Hi, I’m **@AliothZone**, a Master's student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
- 👀 I’m interested in **Linux kernel development** and **heterogeneous computing**. 
- 🌱 I’m currently diving deep into **operating system optimizations**, **RISC-V architectures**, and **parallel computing frameworks**. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source kernel modules**, **system-level performance tuning**, and **heterogeneous computing frameworks**. 
- 📫 Reach me via **[HicRhodus218@gmail.com]**. 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy exploring the intersection of hardware and software, and sometimes hacking on experimental kernel features for fun!
